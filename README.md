From our perspective as healthy individuals who have at least one diabetic person, we are motivated to educate ourselves about diabetes and take a look on a sample that we will analyze and study. This project will also allow us to develop critical skills in data mining and gain insights that could contribute to raising awareness and improving prevention efforts.
