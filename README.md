Motivations:
From our perspective as healthy individuals with at least one diabetic person in our lives, we are motivated to educate ourselves about diabetes and explore a representative dataset through analysis and study. This project will also help us develop critical data mining skills while gaining insights that can contribute to raising awareness and supporting prevention efforts.
We chose this specific diabetes dataset because it includes a variety of relevant medical and demographic attributes, providing a comprehensive foundation for analyzing factors associated with diabetes and uncovering meaningful patterns and insights.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dataset Info:
Number of objects: 1001

Class label: Diabetic (Y), Non-Diabetic(N), or Predict-Diabetic(P).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Attributes:
1) Id: Nominal
2) Gender: Nominal (Binary)
3) Urea: Numeric interval float
4) Cr: Numeric interval float
5) HbA1c: Numeric interval float
6) Chol: Numeric interval float
7) BMI: Numeric ratio float
8) TG: Numeric interval float
9) HDL: Numeric interval float
10) LDL: Numeric interval float
11) VLDL: Numeric interval float
12) Age: Numeric ratio integer
13) Class: Nominal (Binary)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Columns Description:
Id: Unique identifier for each data entry.
Gender: Male Or Female.
LDL: LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) shows the level of "bad cholesterol" in the blood. It is measured in mg/dL and helps check the risk of heart problems in people with diabetes.
Urea: Urea shows the level of waste in the blood from breaking down protein. It is measured in mg/dL and checks kidney health in diabetes.
CR: Creatinine ratio in a diabetic dataset checks kidney health by measuring waste levels in the blood. It helps detect early signs of kidney damage common in diabetes.
HbA1c: measures the average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months and is used to monitor long-term diabetes control.
TG: (Triglycerides) measures blood fat levels and helps assess heart disease risk in diabetics.
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg / height in m^2).
HDL: (High-Density Lipoprotein) is "good cholesterol" that helps protect against heart disease.
VLDL: (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein) is a type of bad cholesterol that can increase heart disease risk by raising fat levels in the blood.
Chol: (Total Cholesterol) measures the overall level of cholesterol in the blood, including both good and bad types, and helps assess heart disease risk.
Age: Age in years.
Class: the patient's diabetes disease class may be Diabetic, Non-Diabetic, or Predict-Diabetic.
