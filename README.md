Motivations:
From our perspective as healthy individuals with at least one diabetic person in our lives, we are motivated to educate ourselves about diabetes and explore a representative dataset through analysis and study. This project will also help us develop critical data mining skills while gaining insights that can contribute to raising awareness and supporting prevention efforts.
We chose this specific diabetes dataset because it includes a variety of relevant medical and demographic attributes, providing a comprehensive foundation for analyzing factors associated with diabetes and uncovering meaningful patterns and insights.
