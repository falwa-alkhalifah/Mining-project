 1. Problem
Diabetes is a serious health issue that affects millions of people around the world.
In this project, we aim to analyze a medical dataset collected from institutions in Iraq that includes measurements
such as cholesterol levels, BMI, blood sugar (HbA1c), and other health indicators.

The goal is to use data mining techniques to better understand the patterns and factors that influence diabetes.
Specifically, we want to classify patients into three categories:
.Diabetic
.Non-Diabetic
.Predict-Diabetic (likely to develop diabetes)

This analysis can help identify early warning signs, support doctors in diagnosing patients more accurately,
and suggest lifestyle or medical changes to prevent complications.

 2. Data Mining Task
The dataset includes 1,000 records and 14 attributes such as age, gender, BMI, cholesterol types, and kidney function indicators.
The class label indicates whether the patient is diabetic, non-diabetic, or likely to become diabetic.

We are applying two main data mining techniques:
1-Classification:
To build a predictive model that classifies new patients based on their health metrics into the
correct diabetes category (Diabetic / Non-Diabetic / Predict-Diabetic).

2-Clustering:
To group patients with similar health profiles together and discover hidden patterns in the data without
using the class label. This can reveal subgroups within the population that share common traits or risk levels.

By combining both methods, we hope to uncover valuable insights into how different health indicators relate to diabetes risk.
